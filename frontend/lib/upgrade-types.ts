/**
 * Shared upgrade-flow data types — used by the public upgrade pages
 * (Smart / Pro / Dominator), the global UpgradeNotice popup, and the
 * admin Upgrades panel.
 *
 * The upgrade flow mirrors the purchase flow on purpose: same shape,
 * same approve / reject ergonomics, same payment-proof mechanics. The
 * only structural differences are:
 *
 *   • An upgrade row carries the buyer's *current* access token + qxl
 *     key + tier so the admin approve flow can revoke them and reissue
 *     fresh credentials for the upgraded tier in a single transaction.
 *   • Approval cleanly transitions the buyer's session: the old
 *     `/access_tokens/{token}` and `/qxl_keys/{key}` rows are removed
 *     and a new pair is minted bound to the same deviceId + username.
