"""
Quotex live chart backend.

Flow
----
  1. You start this script in a terminal (`python main.py`).
  2. It prompts for Quotex email / password in the terminal.
  3. pyquotex connects; if 2FA is required it will prompt for the code
     directly in the terminal (native pyquotex behaviour).
  4. Once logged in, a WebSocket + HTTP server starts on 0.0.0.0:8000.
  5. The Next.js website opens a WebSocket to ws://<host>:8000/ws and:
        - receives the full asset list (all markets) on connect
        - subscribes to whichever asset/timeframe the user picks
        - receives historical candles + live updates
  6. ALSO: a public, always-running USD/BRL OTC 60s stream is started
     automatically on bootstrap. The marketing site (home page) connects
     to /public-otc/ws and receives an immediate snapshot of the rolling
     history buffer plus live candle updates — no subscribe handshake,
     no per-visitor upstream cost.

IMPORTANT: keep your VPN active before running this script, otherwise
Quotex will block the connection.

# Origin allow-list (defense against unauthorized 3rd-party sites stealing

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Background
# ----------
# Starlette's ``CORSMiddleware`` only governs HTTP — it does NOT apply to
# WebSocket handshakes. That means even with a strict ALLOWED_ORIGINS list,
# a browser on any third-party site could still open
# ``wss://privateapi.quotexlive.pro/ws`` and pull live ticks. The fix is
# to read the ``Origin`` header on every websocket handshake (browsers
# always send it on cross-origin WS upgrades and JS cannot spoof it) and
# reject the connection before ``ws.accept()``. We also add an HTTP
# middleware that enforces the same rule on REST endpoints with
# state-changing intent, in case ``ALLOWED_ORIGINS`` is left wide open.
#
# Production
# ----------
# Set ``ALLOWED_ORIGINS`` to a comma-separated list of fully-qualified
# origins, e.g.
#   ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"
# Wildcards like ``https://*.yourdomain.com`` are supported via
# fnmatch-style matching. Origin enforcement on the WebSocket can be
# turned off (NOT recommended) by setting ``ALLOW_ANY_ORIGIN=1`` — useful
# only for local curl / wscat debugging.
#
# Optional shared secret
# ----------------------
# Browsers can't spoof Origin, but non-browser clients (curl, custom
# scripts, scrapers) can. If you set ``WS_SHARED_SECRET`` the backend
# will additionally require ``?key=<secret>`` on the WS URL or an
# ``X-API-Key`` header on REST. The frontend embeds it via
# NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_SHARED_SECRET when it's safe for that environment, or
# proxies through your own server when it isn't.

    # If WE call ``start_candles_stream`` FIRST (the old order), pyquotex
    # accepts our subscribe and starts populating ``candles_data``. Then
    # ``get_candles`` wipes ``candles_data`` and ``clears`` the very
    # event the broker is about to fire. On local PC that's harmless —
    # the WS roundtrip is sub-100ms so the broker re-fires within the
    # 15s ``wait_event`` window. On a VPS in a different region the
    # roundtrip can exceed that window and ``get_candles`` times out
    # empty (the "199 candle fetch hocche na" bug).
    #
    # Doing history first lets ``get_candles`` install its own
    # subscribe + wait_event in a clean state, with no prior
    # subscribe stomping on the event registry. After history lands
    # we issue our own ``start_candles_stream`` for ongoing tick
    # delivery — at that point pyquotex's subscribed-asset registry
    # already has this pair so the second subscribe is essentially

    The home page must NEVER render a candle that was already mid-formation

    a clean 199-bar history (which now contains the just-closed 19:12:00
    bucket as its most recent entry), flips ``gate_open`` to True, and
    broadcasts the fresh snapshot to every connected /public-otc/ws
    client. From that moment on:

      * The chart paints exactly 199 broker-authoritative closed candles
        plus 1 brand-new forming candle (= 200 total displayed).
      * Live ticks for the new (post-boundary) bucket flow through
        normally, populating the 200th candle from open onwards.
      * CandleStore's closed-bucket locking semantics still apply, so
        OHLC for the 199 closed bars is immutable.

    Resolve USD/BRL OTC, load REST history **once**, start the candle

    History-load policy (matches the reference engine.py from
    ``cleitonleonel/pyquotex``'s qxlivechart sample, and pyquotex's own
    Section 7 WebSocket guidance):
      * REST ``get_candles`` / ``get_historical_candles`` is fetched
        **only on first resolve** (or when the persistent buffer is
        empty after a restart). It seeds the rolling buffer.
      * From that point on every subsequent candle — both the
        currently-forming bucket and each just-closed bucket — comes
        from the WebSocket realtime tick stream via
        :meth:`QuotexSession.stream_candles` and the
        :class:`CandleStore` bucket-state machine. The WS stream is
        the authoritative source for recent buckets; REST is allowed
        to silently return flat OHLC for buckets it has not yet
        finalised.
      * We never re-fetch REST history on a timer. The previous
        revision did this every 60 s and clobbered the WS-built
        buffer with REST's flat-OHLC trailing candles — which is the
        root cause of the "ager 1 theke 7 ta candle line dekhay → 30
        s te heal → abar same" cycle the user reported. Removing the
        periodic REST refresh removes the bug at its source.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Signal generation — concurrency hardening
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# What used to happen
# -------------------
# Every click on "Generate Signal" hit ``session.get_history()`` (an
# upstream broker request) AND then ran ``strategies_analyze()``
# (CPU-bound) on the FastAPI event loop. With many users clicking
# simultaneously this caused:
#   * N parallel duplicate broker requests for the same (asset, period)
#     → upstream throttling → 502/409 cascading to every user
#   * the event loop blocking on CPU work → ticks lag for everyone
#
# What we do now
# --------------
# 1. **Shared in-memory buffer first** — we already maintain a live
#    ``candle_store[(asset, period)]`` that's continuously fed by the
#    one-session-per-pair streamer. Every signal request reads from
#    that buffer first; we only fall back to ``session.get_history()``
#    when no shared buffer exists yet (very first user on a brand-new
#    pair). That means N concurrent users on a warm pair = 0 broker
#    requests, regardless of N.
# 2. **Singleflight on the broker fallback** — if multiple users do
#    hit the cold path simultaneously, only ONE upstream fetch fires;
#    the rest await the same future.
# 3. **Short-TTL response cache** — identical (asset, period, count)
#    requests within ``SIGNAL_CACHE_TTL_S`` (default 1.5s) reuse the
#    same SignalResponse. Tens of clicks per second collapse to one
#    actual analysis pass.
# 4. **CPU offload** — ``strategies_analyze`` runs in the default
#    threadpool via ``asyncio.to_thread`` so heavy strategy math
#    doesn't stall the event loop and starve WebSocket ticks.
# 5. **Per-IP cap** — a tiny in-process token bucket prevents one
#    abusive client from monopolizing the path.
